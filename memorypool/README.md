# Memory Pool

**Question**: Design a memory pool in Go for efficient memory allocation and deallocation. Explain its use cases.

**Follow-up**: How would you manage fragmentation within the pool? Provide a sample implementation.
___
**Answer**: Use sync.Pool to reuse memory buffers, reducing the overhead of frequent allocations. This is useful for high-performance applications like HTTP servers. To manage fragmentation, ensure buffers are returned to the pool after use.
